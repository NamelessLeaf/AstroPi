Plans are here:
Multi program using lots of basic functions that may be needed and a fitness test,
fitness test taken on earth is compared to one in space using equiptment
we could also simulate 0 g and compare a fitness test in there to space and see how different the results are 
possible ideas for comparisons:
- 100m sprint (compare avg time, highest speed, lowest speed, avg. speed)
